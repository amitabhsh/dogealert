Windows 7 SideBar Gadget to Monitor DogeCoin prices.  Please set the low and high bound prices that you would like to monitor. I could not test the barking part due to a non SP1 Windows 7, but the same thing works in chrome/Firefox.
You can still use this gadget minus the sidebar, If you are on linux/mac, just open up the currency.html and set low and high bounds. It will bark when any of the thresholds are crossed.

* Installation Instructions *

1. Copy the repository folder to C:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets 
2. Open "Add Gadgets to Desktop"
3. You will see DogeAlert in the available options. Install.

Special thanks to Cryptsy and Yahoo apis.

To modify for any other market, just change the market id in the url in currency.html. You can replace the audio.wav with any other sound if required. If you are having any issues with wav files,
please copy any mp3 file and replace the references to audio.wav in the code.

Please comment on github for any bugs or requests.
